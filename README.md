# Learning Tkinter 

Tkinter is the inbuilt python module that is used to create GUI applications. 
It is one of the most commonly used modules for creating GUI applications in 
Python as it is simple and easy to work with. You donâ€™t need to worry about 
the installation of the Tkinter module separately as it comes with Python already. It gives an object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
